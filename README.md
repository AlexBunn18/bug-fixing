# wtfiswronghere
A collection of simple errors that beginners are likely to hit when they start to write Python code. The idea is to present a safe-to-fail environment in which beginners can experience errors and try to solve them on their own. 

We present small code samples that have errors in them. Initially, there is only one error and it is relatively easy to spot. As we move up challenges, there are multiple errors and subtle bugs. 

By working through these examples, we hope you get better at:

* reading errors
* debugging
* reading and editing other people's code 
* Googling for specific issues
* solving errors on your own


# How to use this project

1. Fork or clone or download this repository
2. In your prompt, navigate to each challenge directory (e.g.: `01_challenge`)
3. Run the one Python script in the challenge directory (`python 01_challenge.py`)
4. It should throw an error that reads similar to the one .png in the challenge directory
5. Fix the error and rerun
6. If all goes good, you should see the output of running fizz buzz
7. Once you fix the issue, update the readme file in the challenge directory (`01_readme.md`) with:

    a. what part of the error message gace you a clue

    b. how you set about solving the issue (e.g.: I Googled)
    
    c. summarize what you learned. 

8. Don't forget to commit your fixed code and updated readme
